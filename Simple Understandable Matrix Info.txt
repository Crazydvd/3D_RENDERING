Transform: Mirror the matrix with the diagonal.


Determinant 2x2/3x3: Write the matrix twice, next to eachother and multiply entries along the diagonals
and back-diagonals, adding the diagonal terms and subtracting the backdiagonal terms.


Cofactor: Play bomberman with a specific row&column then take determinant of remaining matrix (minor)
It's either positive or negative, given by a checkerboard pattern.


Determinant 4x4 (also NxN): Pick a row OR column, multiply every element in the row/column with their cofactor,
then add all the results together.


Extra info: The determinant in 2D is the signed area of the figure where the basic vectors are the sides;
the determinant in 3D is the volume of the figure where the basic vectors are the edges.


Classical adjoint (adj M): Compute the cofactor of every value in the matrix.
Make a new matrix with all the results.
Transform this new matrix.


Inverse Matrix: Divide Classical adjoint by the determinant (	adj M / |M|	).
(divide every value in the matrix by the determinant).
